Hi, Hello World!
Sept 18th, 2018
Happy morning, sunny day!

Bud here, 

I start to document my programming journey...

I've worked on Embedded System projects for 4 years in the past: DVD player, TV, and microwave oven using C and C++ language.

Then I moved into web development projects for another 4 years using wordpress and shopify with some online marketing skills (fb ads, google adwords, and email marketing)

Now (the past 5 months) is my journey into back-end developer using python, ruby on rails, docker, etc, and will keep doing my best to dive into it!

and the next target is the front end developer!
